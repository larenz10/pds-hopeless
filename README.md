# pds-project2016

This repository contains the code I developed in C# to solve the assignment of "Programmazione di Sistema" (A.Y. 2015/2016), a
course I attended at Politecnico di Torino.

## What the code contains

The code contains a Client developed in C#. Once connected to a specific server (at a given address and port), it monitors the server activity (windows opening, closing, focus changing): it can even send key combinations to the focused application. Combinations are formed by one or more modifier keys (CTRL/ALT/SHIFT) and a single key.

## Disclaimer

I take **no responsibility** if you decide to copy or reuse (or whatever else you want to do with) this code.
